Furniture Frenzy
===============

A Windows/Linux/MacOSX puzzle game where you have to guide a blue table out
of a hosue. In the same theme as Rush Hour.

This is a simple implemntation of a simple game focusing on the game mechanics
and keeping the project small. The images are salvaged from an older version
of furniture frenzy for J2ME but the code is entirely new as the original
java code was lost.

The source code is used in a tutorial for building simple games. see http://madebyryan.blogspot.com/
